# A C Project

**This is a simple C project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the third semester class Operating Systems 
and is a simple C programm neccessary to pass the class_


> #### Description of project 
>
>>A program written with compatibility with Posix and uses Posix Threads to increase or/and decrease a global variable creating a child process and threads.
>> 1. The program implements a function called change_number that can increase (or decrease) a universal integer variable by a step given by the user.
>> 2. The program creates a subsidiary process in its execution and implements change_number twice in a different way: the parent process reduces its own copy of the global variable by 1, while the subsidiary increases its own copy of the global variable by 2.
>> 3. The subsidiary process will create two threads: one will increase the value of one variable and the second will reduce the value of the same variable.
